Class/CSV version 0.04
===============================

Do'h just noticed the getline_hr method on Text::CSV.  It's probably 
not worth continuing these tweaks.

Caveat Emptor: This is a work in progress.  I'm modifying the existing
CPAN module.  Possibly with an aim to get it updated on CPAN eventually
but right now just to solve my problem.

===============================

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.
